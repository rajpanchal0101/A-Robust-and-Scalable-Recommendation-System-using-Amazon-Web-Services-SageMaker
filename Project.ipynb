One of Amazon's earliest successes was the \"Customers who bought this, also bought...\" feature, while the million dollar Netflix Prize spurred research, raised public awareness, and inspired numerous other data science competitions.\n\nRecommender systems can utilize a multitude of data sources and ML algorithms, and most combine various unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning techniques into a holistic framework.  However, the core component is almost always a model which which predicts a user's rating (or purchase) for a certain item based on that user's historical ratings of similar items as well as the behavior of other similar users.  The minimal required dataset for this is a history of user item ratings.  In our case, we'll use 1 to 5 star ratings from over 2M Amazon customers on over 160K digital videos.  More details on this dataset can be found at its [AWS Public Datasets page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html).\n\nMatrix factorization has been the cornerstone of most user-item prediction models.  This method starts with the large, sparse, user-item ratings in a single matrix, where users index the rows, and items index the columns.  It then seeks to find two lower-dimensional, dense matrices which, when multiplied together, preserve the information and relationships in the larger matrix.\n\n![image](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/images/Matrixfactor.svg)\n\nMatrix factorization has been extended and genarlized with deep learning and embeddings.  These techniques allows us to introduce non-linearities for enhanced performance and flexibility.  This notebook will fit a neural network-based model to generate recommendations for the Amazon video dataset.  It will start by exploring our data in the notebook and even training a model on a sample of the data.  Later we'll expand to the full dataset and fit our model using a SageMaker managed training cluster.  We'll then deploy to an endpoint and check our method.\n\n---\n\n## Setup\n\n_This notebook was created and tested on an ml.p2.xlarge notebook instance._\n\nLet's start by specifying:\n\n- The S3 bucket and prefix that you want to use for training and model data.  This should be within the same region as the Notebook Instance, training, and hosting.\n- The IAM role arn used to give training and hosting access to your data. See the documentation for how to create these.  Note, if more than one role is required for notebook instances, training, and/or hosting, please replace the `get_execution_role()` call with the appropriate full IAM role arn string(s).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install sagemaker","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import sagemaker\nimport boto3\n\nrole = sagemaker.get_execution_role()\nregion = boto3.Session().region_name\n\n# S3 bucket for saving code and model artifacts.\n# Feel free to specify a different bucket and prefix\nbucket = sagemaker.Session().default_bucket()\nprefix = \"sagemaker/DEMO-gluon-recsys\"","metadata":{"isConfigCell":true,"tags":["parameters"],"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let's load the Python libraries we'll need for the remainder of this example notebook.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport mxnet as mx\nfrom mxnet import gluon, nd, ndarray\nfrom mxnet.metric import MSE\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sagemaker.mxnet import MXNet\nimport json\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## Data\n\n### Explore\n\nLet's start by bringing in our dataset from an S3 public bucket.

This could serve as the foundation of a recommender system in a variety of use cases.  However, there are many ways in which it could be improved.  For example we did very little with:\n- hyperparameter tuning\n- controlling for overfitting (early stopping, dropout, etc.)\n- testing whether binarizing our target variable would improve results\n- including other information sources (video genres, historical ratings, time of review)\n- adjusting our threshold for user and item inclusion \n\nIn addition to improving the model, we could improve the engineering by:\n- Setting the context and key value store up for distributed training\n- Fine tuning our data ingestion (e.g. num_workers on our data iterators) to ensure we're fully utilizing our GPU\n- Thinking about how pre-processing would need to change as datasets scale beyond a single machine\n\nBeyond that, recommenders are a very active area of research and techniques from active learning, reinforcement learning, segmentation, ensembling, and more should be investigated to deliver well-rounded recommendations.\n\n### Clean-up (optional)\n\nLet's finish by deleting our endpoint to avoid stray hosting charges.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"predictor.delete_model()\npredictor.delete_endpoint()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Notebook CI Test Results\n\nThis notebook was tested in multiple regions.
